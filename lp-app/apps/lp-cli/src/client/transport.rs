//! Client-side transport trait
//!
//! Defines the async interface for client-side transport implementations.
//! Messages are consumed (moved) on send, and receive operations are async.

/// Trait for client-side transport implementations
///
/// This trait provides an async interface for sending and receiving messages.
/// Messages are consumed (moved) on send. Receive operations are async and will
/// yield to the async runtime when waiting for data.
///
/// The transport handles serialization/deserialization internally.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use lp_cli::client::transport::ClientTransport;
/// use lp_model::{ClientMessage, ServerMessage, TransportError};
///
/// struct MyTransport;
///
/// #[async_trait::async_trait]
/// impl ClientTransport for MyTransport {
///     async fn send(&mut self, msg: ClientMessage) -> Result<(), TransportError> {
///         // Send message (transport handles serialization)
///         Ok(())
///     }
///
///     async fn receive(&mut self) -> Result<ServerMessage, TransportError> {
///         // Receive message (transport handles deserialization)
///         // This will wait until a message is available
///         # Err(TransportError::ConnectionLost)
///     }
///
///     async fn close(&mut self) -> Result<(), TransportError> {
///         // Close the transport
///         Ok(())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
