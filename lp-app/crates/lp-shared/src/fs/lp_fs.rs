//! Filesystem abstraction trait
//!
//! All paths in this trait are relative to the project root. The project root is the directory
//! containing `project.json`. Leading slashes indicate paths from the project root
//! (e.g., `/project.json`, `/src/my-shader.shader/main.glsl`).
//!
//! Filesystem instances have a root path (especially for real filesystem implementations) to
//! provide security by preventing access outside the project directory.
