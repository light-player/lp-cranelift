# Plan: Create Comprehensive Struct Tests

## Overview

Create a complete test suite for GLSL structures in `lightplayer/crates/lp-glsl-filetests/filetests/structs/` following the flat naming convention with prefixes. These tests will comprehensively cover the GLSL structure specification including struct definitions, constructors, member access, assignment, and operations. These tests are expected to fail initially, serving as a specification for implementing struct support in the compiler.

## Directory Structure

Following the flat naming convention with prefixes, create tests in a single `structs/` directory:

## Test File Patterns

Each test file should follow the pattern from other test suites:

```glsl
// test run
// target riscv32.fixed32

// ============================================================================
// Description of what is being tested
// ============================================================================

struct Point {
    float x;
    float y;
};

float test_struct_operation_name() {
    Point p = Point(1.0, 2.0);
    // Test implementation
    return result;
    // Should be expected_value
}

// run: test_struct_operation_name() ~= expected_value
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Test Format**: Follow the exact format from other test suites with:
   - Header comments describing what's tested
   - Multiple test functions per file
   - `// run:` directives with expected results
   - Comments explaining expected behavior

2. **Coverage**: Ensure tests cover:
   - All struct definition forms (simple, with vectors, nested, with arrays)
   - All struct constructor forms (scalars, vectors, mixed, nested, arrays)
   - Member access (scalar, vector, nested, array members)
   - Struct assignment (whole struct, member assignment, nested)
   - Struct operators (==, !=, ?:)
   - Structs in functions (parameters, return types)
   - Struct initialization (constructors, initializer lists)
   - Edge cases and error conditions

3. **Key Struct Features**:
   - Structs are user-defined aggregate types
   - Structs must have at least one member
   - Struct members are initialized in declaration order
   - Struct constructors require exactly one argument per member
   - Struct assignment requires same type, cannot contain opaque types
   - Struct equality compares all members recursively
   - Anonymous and embedded structs are not supported
   - Member types must be already defined (no forward references)

4. **Expected Failures**: These tests are expected to fail initially, especially:
   - Struct constructors
   - Struct equality operators
   - Nested structs
   - Structs with array members
   - Structs in function parameters/returns
   - Initializer list syntax
   - Member access for nested structs

## Files to Create

Create 35 test files in the flat `structs/` directory structure above, with each file containing 3-10 test functions following the established pattern. All files use the prefix naming convention:

- `define-*` for struct definitions
- `constructor-*` for struct constructors
- `access-*` for member access
- `assign-*` for struct assignment
- `*-operator.glsl` for operators
- `function-*` for function usage
- `*-struct.glsl` for storage/scope
- `initializer-*` for initialization
- `edge-*` for edge cases and errors

## GLSL Spec References

- **variables.adoc**: Structures (lines 813-912), Structure members (lines 852-912)
- **operators.adoc**: Structure constructors (lines 297-325), Structure and Array Operations (lines 624-700)
- **statements.adoc**: Function definitions with struct parameters and return types
