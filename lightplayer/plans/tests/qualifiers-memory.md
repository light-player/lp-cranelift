# Plan: Create Comprehensive Memory Qualifier Tests

## Overview

Create a complete test suite for GLSL memory qualifiers in `lightplayer/crates/lp-glsl-filetests/filetests/qualifiers/memory/` following the flat naming convention with prefixes. These tests will comprehensively cover memory qualifiers (coherent, volatile, restrict, readonly, writeonly) for buffer blocks and image variables. These tests are expected to fail initially, serving as a specification for implementing memory qualifier support in the compiler.

## Directory Structure

Following the flat naming convention with prefixes, create tests in a single `qualifiers/memory/` directory:

```javascript
qualifiers/memory/
├── coherent-basic.glsl            (coherent qualifier)
├── coherent-reads.glsl             (coherent reads see previous writes)

├── coherent-barrier.glsl           (coherent with memoryBarrier)
├── volatile-basic.glsl             (volatile qualifier)
├── volatile-refetch.glsl           (volatile always refetches)
├── volatile-write-through.glsl     (volatile always writes through)

├── image-volatile.glsl              (volatile on image variables)
├── image-restrict.glsl              (restrict on image variables)
├── image-readonly.glsl              (readonly on image variables)

├── multiple-memory.glsl             (multiple memory qualifiers)
├── edge-non-coherent-cache.glsl    (non-coherent may be cached)
└── edge-memory-access-order.glsl   (memory access order undefined)
```

## Test File Patterns

Each test file should follow the pattern from other test suites:

```glsl
// test run
// target riscv32.fixed32

// ============================================================================
// Description of what is being tested
// ============================================================================

coherent buffer DataBlock {
    float data[];
};

float test_coherent_buffer() {
    return data[0];
    // Should use coherent access
}

// run: test_coherent_buffer() ~= expected_value
```

### 3. Restrict Qualifier

## Implementation Notes

1. **Test Format**: Follow the exact format from other test suites with:
   - Header comments describing what's tested
   - Multiple test functions per file
   - `// run:` directives with expected results
   - Comments explaining expected behavior

2. **Coverage**: Ensure tests cover:
   - All memory qualifiers (coherent, volatile, restrict, readonly, writeonly)
   - Qualifiers on buffer blocks
   - Qualifiers on image variables
   - Multiple qualifiers
   - Error cases (readonly write, writeonly read)
   - Memory access behavior

3. **Key Characteristics**:
   - Coherent ensures visibility across invocations
   - Volatile prevents caching and implies coherent
   - Restrict allows optimizations (no aliasing)
   - Readonly prevents writes
   - Writeonly prevents reads
   - Memory accesses complete in undefined order without barriers

4. **Expected Failures**: These tests are expected to fail initially, especially:
   - Memory qualifier parsing
   - Coherent/volatile behavior
   - Restrict optimization
   - Readonly/writeonly restrictions
   - Error detection

5. **Reference Files**:
   - Pattern: `lightplayer/crates/lp-glsl-filetests/filetests/globals/declare-buffer.glsl`
   - Pattern: `lightplayer/crates/lp-glsl-filetests/filetests/interface-blocks/buffer-basic.glsl`

## Files to Create

Create 30 test files in the `qualifiers/memory/` directory structure above, with each file containing 3-10 test functions following the established pattern. All files use the prefix naming convention:

- `coherent-*` for coherent qualifier

- `writeonly-*` for writeonly qualifier
- `buffer-*` for buffer block qualifiers
