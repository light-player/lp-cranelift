//! Cranelift compilation context and main entry point.
//!
//! When compiling many small functions, it is important to avoid repeatedly allocating and
//! deallocating the data structures needed for compilation. The `Context` struct is used to hold
//! on to memory allocations between function compilations.
//!
//! The context does not hold a `TargetIsa` instance which has to be provided as an argument
//! instead. This is because an ISA instance is immutable and can be used by multiple compilation
//! contexts concurrently. Typically, you would have one context per compilation thread and only a
//! single ISA instance.
